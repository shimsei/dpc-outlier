Detecting outliers using density peak clustering

Density peak clustering is developed by Laio and Rodriguez 
https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1242072

This function adapts the algorithm for finding outliers.
The output is probabaility of being outlier for each point based on local and global patterns in addition to their assigned cluster number.
